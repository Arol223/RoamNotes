#+title: Planned Teaching Activity
#+date: [2022-11-28 Mon 16:33]


* Adjusted planning:
** Lesson details:
1. Course: Basic concepts in power system control
2. Title of Lesson: Introduction to voltage control
3. Class/Year: 4
4. Course concepts:
   1. Importance of maintaining steady voltages in the grid
   2. Connection between reactive power and voltage levels
   3. How local voltage/reactive power control contributes to lower
      transmission costs and reduced energy consumption
5. Aims and objectives of Teaching:
   - The students will learn about some of the limitations of
     transmitting power over long distances
   - The students will learn about some of the solutions to this problem
   - The students will become aware of economic factors behind why
     certain technologies might be chosen
   - Through using the ARISTO power system simulator, the students
     will develop an understanding of how these control measures work
     in practice, and what the limitations of the different
     technologies are


** Teaching Approach:
*** Teaching phase:
1. Introduction with group discussion of why stable voltages are
   necessary (1-2 minutes)
   1. Electronic devices, machines and equipment are designed to
      operate within a narrow range
   2. Higher voltage leads to lower losses (High currents heat lines
      etc) (Why transformers are used)
   3. Over voltage leads to arcing, short circuit faults etc
      (insulators less effective)
2. Introduce reactive power
   1. $\bar{S} = U\cdot I(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \equiv P + iQ$ sign of Q
      determines "production" or "consumption"
      power is created by the current that is out of phase with the
      voltage, current ahead of voltage \rightarrow production, otherwise consumption
   2. Still creates losses when transmitted by $P_{loss} = IR^{2}$
   3. Demonstrate with circuit simulation how having shunt capacitor
      will phase compensate and increase voltage
   4. Relate high inductance to high reactive power consumption
3. Discuss shunt capacitors
   1. Introduce shunt capacitors, e.g. "This is one of the ways it is
      done in the real grid"
   2. Show in ARISTO: This is what happens when reactive load increases
   3. Demonstrate switching on shunt capacitors
4. Introduce ARISTO-exercise
   1. Your job is to get the voltages is this bus to nominal level

*** Teaching and learning approach
1. Individual brainstorming
2. Group discussion
3. Visual demonstration


*** Media/Tools:
1. Online circuit simulator for demonstration
2. Offline power system simulator to try control concepts
3. Slides, Menti?
** Skills & Competences
*** Cognitive Knowledge/Objective
1. Understand how phase compensation is used to regulate voltage,
   produce reactive power
2. Understand how shunts can be used for phase compensation/voltage
   control
*** Social/Communication:
1. Collaboration
2. Group Dynamics
*** Meta-Cognitive
1. Self esteem: developing and enhancing understanding through practice
2. Critical thinking through reasoning about which actions are
   appropriate for a certain situation

** Assessment
- Short report on findings when working with the simulator

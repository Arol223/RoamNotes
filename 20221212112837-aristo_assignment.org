#+title: Aristo Assignment

* Unclear questions:
- Where is the frequency measured? Why?
  The frequency in ARISTO is measured at the generators or generator
  buses. The why is more unclear, as the frequency could in principle
  be measured anywhere. As long as the system is synchronised, all
  generators should have the same frequency.

 - Need to revise how generator control works (if this is one of the
   assignments I'll be responsible for), e.g. how droop is calculated
   etc, and in addition how the block diagrams for governors work.

  Nothing else unclear in this assignment

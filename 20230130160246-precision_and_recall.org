* Precision:

** Glossary:
- TP = True Positive
- FP = False Positive
** Definition:
- $\mathrm{Precision} = \frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP + FP}}$
- Interpretation: The precision gives the probability that a
  classification result saying positive is a true positive



* Recall:
** Glossary:
- FN = False Negative

** Definition:
- $\mathrm{Recall} = \frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP + FN}}$
- Interpretation: The recall answers the question what proportion of
  actual positives was identified correctly?

- Example: Power System Classifier has a recall of 0.11 for unstable
  cases. This means that it correctly identifies 11% of all unstable
  cases.

Precsion and recall are often in tension, so improving recall may
worsen precision.

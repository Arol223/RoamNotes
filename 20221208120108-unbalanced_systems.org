#+title: Unbalanced Systems
#+date: [2022-12-08 Thu 12:01]

* Motivation:
- Unbalanced systems are difficult to analyse; unbalanced means three
  phases are not equal in magnitude and are not symmetrically phase displaced
- Any unbalanced system of $N$ phasors can be represented by N systems
  of balanced phasors
- In case of unsymmetrical 3-phase system: 3 systems of 3 balanced
  phasors
- The components are called /positive/ sequence, /negative/  sequence and
  /zero/ sequence
  - Positive sequence has same sequence as original system,
    i.e. /a-b-c/, negative sequence /a-c-b/, both with $120^{\circ}$  phase
    shift between phases, and zero sequence has all components in phase
